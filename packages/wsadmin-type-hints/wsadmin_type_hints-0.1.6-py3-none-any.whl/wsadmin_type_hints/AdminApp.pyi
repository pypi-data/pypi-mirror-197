"""
Use the `AdminApp` object to **install**, **modify**, and **administer applications**.

The `AdminApp` object interacts with the WebSphereÂ® Application Server management 
and configuration services to make application inquiries and changes.

This interaction includes installing and uninstalling applications, listing modules, 
exporting, and so on.

For more info see the [official documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-nd/8.5.5?topic=scripting-commands-adminapp-object-using-wsadmin).
