# ipfabric_http_auth

**DEPRECATED: THIS WAS REMOVE IN `ipfabric` PACKAGE IN v6.1.0**

IPFabric is a Python module for connecting to and communicating against an IP Fabric instance.

## About

Founded in 2015, [IP Fabric](https://ipfabric.io/) develops network infrastructure visibility and analytics solution to
help enterprise network and security teams with network assurance and automation across multi-domain heterogeneous
environments. From in-depth discovery, through graph visualization, to packet walks and complete network history, IP
Fabric enables to confidently replace manual tasks necessary to handle growing network complexity driven by relentless
digital transformation.

## Installation

```
pip install ipfabric_httpx_auth
```

## Development

IPFabric uses poetry for the python packaging module. Install poetry globally:

```
pip install poetry
```

To install a virtual environment run the following command in the root of this directory.

```
poetry install
```

To test and build:

```
poetry run pytest
poetry build
```

GitHub Actions will publish and release. Make sure to tag your commits:

* ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* docs: No changes just documentation
* test: Added test cases
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
* feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
* BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking
  API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
