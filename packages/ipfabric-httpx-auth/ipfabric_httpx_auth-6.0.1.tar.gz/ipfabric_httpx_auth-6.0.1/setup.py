From in-depth discovery, through graph visualization, to packet walks and complete network history, IP\nFabric enables to confidently replace manual tasks necessary to handle growing network complexity driven by relentless\ndigital transformation.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install ipfabric_httpx_auth\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIPFabric uses poetry for the python packaging module. Install poetry globally:\n\n```\npip install poetry\n```\n\nTo install a virtual environment run the following command in the root of this directory.\n\n```\npoetry install\n```\n\nTo test and build:\n\n```\npoetry run pytest\npoetry build\n```\n\nGitHub Actions will publish and release. Make sure to tag your commits:\n\n* ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\n* docs: No changes just documentation\n* test: Added test cases\n* perf: A code change that improves performance\n* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)\n* fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).\n* feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).\n* BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking\n  API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.\n',
