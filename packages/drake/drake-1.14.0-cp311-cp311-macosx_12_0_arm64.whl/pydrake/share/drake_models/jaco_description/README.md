# Kinova Jaco meshes

This folder contains meshes of the 6-dof and 7-dof 3-finger Kinova Jaco arms.

The files were originally taken from the Kinova ROS package as of
https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/tree/006c2e1a/kinova_description
That repository was shared under the BSD-3-Clause license terms.

Drake used meshlab to convert the original STL meshes to the OBJ format.
