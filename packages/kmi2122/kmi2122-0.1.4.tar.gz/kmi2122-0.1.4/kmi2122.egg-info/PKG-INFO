## Stats
- 24 monthly sequences from Jan, 2022 to Dec, 2023
- 2,201 Korean statistical columns from 57 tables in one dataframe

<br>

## Description
This dataset merges monthly economic indicators provided by the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) into a single data frame. The data covers a total of 24 sequences from January 2021 to December 2022 and includes information in 24 columns.

To solve the problem of encoding Korean characters and having many columns in one data frame, the column names were changed to table{int}_col{int}. This change is reflected in the data, making it easy to use, as demonstrated in the following example.

This dataset provides valuable information for time series data analysis and modeling, enabling users to extract information on which indicators require more focus and predict values using several economic indicators. It is expected that this data and lagging techniques will enable the identification of the successors of economic indicators.

The column names of the dataset have been maintained in Korean. In addition, you can check the 57 statistics file names in Korean through the key value of table_list in kmi_dataset_column_info. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we do not provide English-translated values as changing Korean to English can make it difficult for users to compare with the original data on KOSIS.

Also, if there are columns with missing values in some tables, the columns with missing values have been removed. Therefore, please note that the entire dataset does not have any missing values.
