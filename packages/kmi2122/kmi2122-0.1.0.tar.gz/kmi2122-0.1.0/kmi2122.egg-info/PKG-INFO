# kmi2122-dataset: A Collection of Korea Macroeconomic Indicators from 2021-2022 (Monthly, 24 Sequences)
## Description
This dataset merges monthly economic indicators provided by the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) into a single data frame. The data covers a total of 24 sequences from January 2021 to December 2022 and includes information in 24 columns.

To solve the problem of encoding Korean characters and having many columns in one data frame, the column names were changed to table{int}_col{int}. This change is reflected in the data, making it easy to use, as demonstrated in the following example.

This dataset provides valuable information for time series data analysis and modeling, enabling users to extract information on which indicators require more focus and predict values using several economic indicators. It is expected that this data and lagging techniques will enable the identification of the successors of economic indicators.
