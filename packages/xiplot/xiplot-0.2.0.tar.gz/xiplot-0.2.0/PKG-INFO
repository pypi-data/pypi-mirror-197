# &chi;iplot

&chi;iplot, pronounced like "kaiplot"[^1], is a web-first visualisation platform for multidimensional data, implemented in the `xiplot` Python package.

[^1]: Pronouncing &chi;iplot like "xaiplot" is also recognised.

## Description

&chi;iplot is built on top of the [`dash`](https://github.com/plotly/dash) framework with its various extensions (see the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file). The goal of the &chi;iplot is to explore new insights from the collected data and to make data exploring user-friendly and intuitive.

&chi;iplot can be executed in server version or WASM-based browser version. 

## Dependencies

Install the depencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Execution

### Server version

Run `python3 -m xiplot` at the root directory.

### Serverless WASM version

You can try out the serverless WASM version of &chi;iplot at [www.edahelsinki.fi/xiplot](https://www.edahelsinki.fi/xiplot). Please refer to the [wasm](https://github.com/edahelsinki/xiplot/tree/wasm#readme) branch for more information on how the WASM version is implemented.

## User guide

You can find the user guide [here](docs/user_guide).

## Funding

The `xiplot` application was created by [Akihiro Tanaka](https://github.com/TanakaAkihiro) and [Juniper Tyree](https://github.com/juntyr) as part of their summer internships in Kai Puolamäki's [Exploratory Data Analysis group](https://github.com/edahelsinki) at the University of Helsinki.

Akihiro's internpship was paid for by the Academy of Finland (decision 346376) with funding associated with the VILMA Centre of Excellence. Juniper's internship was paid for by "Future Makers Funding Program 2018 of the Technology Industries of Finland Centennial Foundation, and the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation", with funding associated with the Atmospheric AI programme of the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence.
