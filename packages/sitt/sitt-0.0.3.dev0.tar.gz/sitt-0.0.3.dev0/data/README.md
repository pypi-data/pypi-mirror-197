# Si.T.T. Example Data

In this folder, there are some scripts and explanations on hot to get example data from different sources on the web.


## Copernicus data (weather data)

To get the Copernicus data, you need to install cdsapi and create a `.cdsapirc` file on your machine, see:  
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to
or

Downloading will take quite a while, so be patient and grab a Pizza :-) Well, might as well take the better part of a
day, depending on requests on Copernicus.


## LIDAR height GeoTIFFs
