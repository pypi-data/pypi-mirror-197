    """A logical meter for calculating high level metrics in a microgrid.

    LogicalMeter provides methods for fetching power values from different points in the
    microgrid.  These methods return `FormulaReceiver` objects, which can be used like
    normal `Receiver`s, but can also be composed to form higher-order formula streams.

    Example:
        ``` python
        channel_registry = ChannelRegistry(name="data-registry")

        # Create a channels for sending/receiving subscription requests
        data_source_request_channel = Broadcast[ComponentMetricRequest]("data-source")

        data_source_request_receiver = data_source_request_channel.new_receiver()

        resampling_request_channel = Broadcast[ComponentMetricRequest]("resample")
        resampling_request_sender = resampling_request_channel.new_sender()
        resampling_request_receiver = resampling_request_channel.new_receiver()
