class MovingWindow:
    """
    A data window that moves with the latest datapoints of a data stream.

    After initialization the `MovingWindow` can be accessed by an integer
    index or a timestamp. A sub window can be accessed by using a slice of integers
    integers or timestamps.

    Note that a numpy ndarray is returned and thus users can use
    numpys operations directly on a window.

    The window uses an ringbuffer for storage and the first element is aligned to
    a fixed defined point in time. Since the moving nature of the window, the
    date of the first and the last element are constantly changing and therefore
    the point in time that defines the alignment can be outside of the time window.
    Modulo arithmetic is used to move the `window_alignment` timestamp into the
    latest window.
    If for example the `window_alignment` parameter is set to `datetime(1, 1, 1)`
    and the window size is bigger than one day then the first element will always
    be aligned to the midnight. For further information see also the
    [`OrderedRingBuffer`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries._ringbuffer.OrderedRingBuffer]
    documentation.


    **Example1** (calculating the mean of a time interval):

    ```
    window = MovingWindow(size=100, resampled_data_recv=resampled_data_recv)

    time_start = datetime.now()
    time_end = time_start + timedelta(minutes=5)

    # ... wait for 5 minutes until the buffer is filled
    await asyncio.sleep(5)

    # return an numpy array from the window
    a = window[time_start:time_end]
    # and use it to for example calculate the mean
    mean = a.mean()
    '''

    **Example2** (create a polars data frame from a `MovingWindow`):

    ```
    import polars as pl

    # create a window that stores two days of data
    # starting at 1.1.23 with samplerate=1
    window = MovingWindow(size = (60 * 60 * 24 * 2), sample_receiver)

    # wait for one full day until the buffer is filled
    asyncio.sleep(60*60*24)

    # create a polars series with one full day of data
    time_start = datetime(2023, 1, 1)
    time_end = datetime(2023, 1, 2)
    s = pl.Series("Jan_1", mv[time_start:time_end])
    ```
