# webtoon_data

As an avid WEBTOON reader, I was inspired to create a Python wrapper that would display information regarding the top / hottest / most relevant WEBTOONs available today. There are two sections on the WEBTOON website or app, Canvas and Originals, which refer to content that is published independently and content that is licensed by WEBTOON respectively.

The API I found (on RapidAPI; link below) provides access to all listings available on the WEBTOON platform, in both Canvas and Original. This python wrapper can create ranked lists of any length by genre, provide recommendations with synopses of recommended titles, and get basic information such as names of the author and illustrator and a list of available genres.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install webtoon_data
```

## Usage

Get the title number of a WEBTOON.

```
>>> get_webtoon_num('True Beauty')
>>> The title number for (that WEBTOON) is 1436, hope that helps! :)
```

Get the title name with the title number of a WEBTOON.

```
>>> get_webtoon_title(3210)

Provide a list of genres available on the WEBTOON platform.

>>> ['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Action', 'Slice of life', 'Romance', 'Superhero', 'Sci-fi', 'Thriller', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery', 'Sports', 'Historical', 'Heart-warming', 'Horror', 'Informative']
```

What are the top ranking WEBTOONs in specified genre of n length?

```
>>> get_webtoon_list_ranking('ROMANCE', 25)
>>> ['Lore Olympus', 'Down To Earth', 'Marry My Husband', 'Operation: True Love', 'Maybe Meant to Be', 
'The Doctors are Out', 'Go Away Romeo', 'True Beauty', 'The Kiss Bet', 'Hello Baby', 'SubZero', 'Villain with a Crush',

```

Can you give me a recommendation of a WEBTOON to read from a title I provide?
