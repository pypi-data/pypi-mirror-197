DataDraw is a python function library class to produce many kinds of automated, 
presentable, data-driven 2-D plots / charts / graphics / image annotations in SVG.
It is an all-python server-side solution, generating SVG results which can be 
embedded in html web pages or saved as .svg image files.  No javascript, css, 
or svg knowledge is required.

Axis and legend rendering, tooltips, linkouts, automatic ranging, basic statistics, 
draw primitives.  Handles numeric, log, categorical, and datetime data types.
Leverages SVG's fonts, colors, transparency, image handling, and other aspects.
Works well within frameworks such as flask or django.  Limited interactivity / 
reactivity use-cases.

Tested on linux python 3.6 and 3.9 using recent browser versions; believed to 
be thread-safe.
