### Alternative OWL to FHIR converters
### FHIR-OWL
https://github.com/aehrc/fhir-owl  
Takes a minimalistic approach. Can convert top-level CodeSystem properties, concepts, and also supports some predicates, such as synonyms. Uses Java `owl-api`.

### Ontology Access Kit (OAK)
https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit/
OWL-on-FHIR is largely a wrapper around [Ontology Access Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit/) (OAK)'s FHIR converter. It adds some extra automation such as an intermediary conversion to Obographs JSON, which is currently a required input for OAK for most ontologies, given the current state of development.
