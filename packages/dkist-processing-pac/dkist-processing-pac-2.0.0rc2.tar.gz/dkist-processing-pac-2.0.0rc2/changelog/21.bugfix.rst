Correct how coordinate transformations are applied in the inverse telescope model. The default Mueller Matrix will now
place data into the same coordinate frame used by SDO and HINODE (that is, with North/South oriented along the axis of *solar rotation*).
It will also apply a sign flip to U and V. All of these options can still be turned off if desired.
