# Bundles everything in an Anaconda environment and creates an installer.

## Tested with Anaconda3, Python 3.9.16, Windows 10

## All your py-files and any other file you want to add to your app need to be in the ROOT of your env.

### pip install env2installer

### Please install:

#### pyinstaller

pip install -U pyinstaller 

#### ImageMagick (for the icon)
