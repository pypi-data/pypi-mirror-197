This ap­plic­a­tion was written by `Ben Welsh <http://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/>`_, `Ken Schwencke <http://schwanksta.com/>`_ and `Armand Emamdjomeh <https://twitter.com/emamd>`_ at the `Los Angeles Times Data Desk <http://datadesk.latimes.com>`_. 

The ideas be­hind django-bakery were `first presented at the 2012 con­fer­ence <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IybYcc0eVL-Rchm7lEQNwrM-AHRfr_M8ewfGYYNjeu8/edit>`_ of the `Na­tion­al In­sti­tute for Com­puter-As­sisted Re­port­ing <http://www.ire.org/nicar/>`_. The NICAR com­munity is a con­stant source of chal­lenge and in­spir­a­tion. Many of our ideas, here and else­where, have been ad­ap­ted from things the com­munity has taught us.
