# Spotube

Spotube is a Python package that allows the user to download local `.mp3` copies of Spotify playlists, including cover art, artist information and lyrics.

## Description

The package can be used to download Spotify playlists, retrieving and pairing each song with the cover art as seen on Spotify, as well as any relevant metadata.
The user provides the link to a public spotify playlist, API keys for Spotify and Genius, and, optionally the directory to save the downloaded songs.
The application will then:

- Query the Spotify API for information on each song in the playlist, including the official name, artists, album cover art etc.
- Using the song name and artist(s), search for, and select the most relevant song video on Youtube. If possible, the application will avoid remixes, covers and video clip versions.
- Using the most relevant link, download the video in the highest possible quality, and convert to .mp3 format.
- Query the LyricsGenius API to retrieve the song lyrics, if available.
- Edit the .mp3 tags of the downloaded song to set the artist and album information, add the lyrics and set the cover art.

## Obtaining API keys

For instructions on how to generate the two sets of API keys needed to run the application, please refer to:

- [The Spotify API guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
