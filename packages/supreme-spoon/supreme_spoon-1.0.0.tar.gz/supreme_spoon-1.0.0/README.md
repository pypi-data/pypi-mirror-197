supreme-**S**teps to **P**rocess S**O**SS **O**bservatio**N**s

**supreme-SPOON** is an end-to-end pipeline for NIRISS/SOSS time series observations (TSOs).
The pipeline is divided into four stages:
 - Stage 1: Detector Level Processing 
 - Stage 2: Spectroscopic Processing
 - Stage 3: 1D Spectral Extraction
 - Stage 4: Lightcurve Fitting
 
A major advantage of **supreme-SPOON** over other available NIRISS/SOSS pipelines is the ability to carry out end-to-end reductions (uncalibrated to atmosphere spectra) without relying on intermediate outputs from the JWST DMS.
Furthermore, **supreme-SPOON** is able to run the ATOCA extraction algorithm to explicitly model the order contamination that is known to affect SOSS observations.


## Installation Instructions
The latest release of **supreme-SPOON** can be downloaded from PyPI by running:

    pip install supreme_spoon

or the latest development version can be grabbed from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/radicamc/supreme-spoon
    cd supreme_spoon
    python setup.py install

If you plan on using the ATOCA extraction, it would be beneficial to have the atoca development version of the official jwst pipeline. Multiple critical functionalities have not yet been merged into the master pipeline, but will be soon. 
This can be installed via:

    pip install git+https://github.com/AntoineDarveau/jwst.git@atoca_1.6.0x


## Usage Instructions
The **supreme-SPOON** pipeline can be run in a similar fashion to the JWST DMS, by individually calling each step.
Alternatively, Stages 1 to 3 can be run at once via the ```run_DMS.py``` script.

1. Copy the ```run_DMS.py``` script and the ```run_DMS.yaml``` config file into your working directory.
2. Fill out the yaml file with the appropriate inputs.
3. Once happy with the input parameters, enter ```python run_DMS.py run_DMS.yaml``` in the terminal.

To use the light curve fitting capabilities, simply follow the same procedure with the fit_lightcurves.py and .yaml files. 
Currently only transit light curve fits are supported, with eclipse fitting in development.
