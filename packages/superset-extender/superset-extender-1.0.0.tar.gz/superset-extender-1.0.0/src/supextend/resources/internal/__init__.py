This sub-package defines 2 sub-packages to make a clear distinction
between two apps:
    1. The superset batch cleaner: designed for a scheduled cleanup of
    superset by scheduling tools such as Airflow.

    2. workspace extension: designed as an additional functionality for
    superset to be able to have a higher container for entities like
    dashboards and charts.
