# What is TOPSIS

Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal

TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal
solution.

### In Command Prompt
```
>> topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1" "-,+,-,+"
```

## Example

The decision matrix (`a`) should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, R<sup>2</sup>, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.

Using TOPSIS the rankings are displayed in the form of a table , with the 1st rank offering the best decision, and last rank offering the worst decision making.
