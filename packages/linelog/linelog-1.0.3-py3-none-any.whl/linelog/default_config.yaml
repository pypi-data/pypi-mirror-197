# Ignore any directory that regex matches these patterns

patterns: 
- Example/
- build/
- dist/
- \..*/

# language specific rules for line counting
# the below regex patterns are removed before lines are counted
# the matching is multiline, so use ^$ for single line patterns
# multiple comma-separated languages can share patterns

# IMPORTANT! These patterns are compiled with the 'dotall' and 'multiline' flags, which allows for targeting multiline 
# comments and docstrings. However this also means for patterns intended to match a single line, you need to use non-greedy quantifiers (*?) and end the pattern with '$'. See the patterns for // and # style comments.
lines:

    any:
  # the 'any' field is used for all filetypes 
  # the default pattern strips whitespace lines
    - ^\s*$

  # ignore lines with 2 or fewer whitespace characters
    - ^\S{,2}$

    c,rust,c++:

  # /* c-style comments */
    - /\*.*?\*/  

  # //c++ style single line comments
    - //.*?$

    python,shell:
  # octothorpe comments 
    - \#.*?$  

    scheme, Common Lisp:
    - ;;.*?$
