# IDAES Examples

This repository contains example Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate and  explain 
the  capabilities of the IDAES platform.

Below are basic instructions to install, view, and run the examples.

If you are a developer who wishes to modify or add new notebooks, please refer to the file *README-developer.md*.

### Categories of examples

In the source code repository, you may note that there are a number of examples that are not in the documentation.
There are two main categories of examples:

  - "Docs" examples (under `idaes_examples/notebooks/docs`), which are tested and built into this documentation.
  - "Active" examples (under `idaes_examples/notebooks/active`) that are tested but *not* in the documentation.

There is also a third category of "Held" examples (under `idaes_examples/notebooks/held`),
which could in the next release of IDAES in Docs or Active, or could be removed.
These are *not* tested and *not* in the docs, and should generally be ignored by non-developers.

## Installation

This repository can be installed with *pip*:
```shell
pip install idaes-examples
```

We recommend you use a virtual environment tool such as
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
to install and run the notebooks in an isolated environment.

## Run examples

Use the command 
```
idaesx gui
```
to get a simple graphical UI that lets you 
browse and open notebooks (with Jupyter) for local execution and experimentation.
The GUI will show the description of each notebook and allow selection of tutorial or exercise versions of the notebook, if these exist.

Alternately, you may use Jupyter notebook's file browser in the installed notebooks directory,
using the `idaesx where` command to find that directory:
`jupyter notebook $(idaesx where)`.

Only the source notebooks (ending in '_src.ipynb') are included in the repository.
The `idaesx gui` command will generate the other versions, or you can run preprocessing manually with: `idaesx pre -d "$(idaesx where)\.."`.


## Build documentation

Run the command `idaesx build` from the repository root to build the [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) 
documentation.


*Note: This will take quite a while, as each example must be run first.
You may want to step out and enjoy a beverage.*
