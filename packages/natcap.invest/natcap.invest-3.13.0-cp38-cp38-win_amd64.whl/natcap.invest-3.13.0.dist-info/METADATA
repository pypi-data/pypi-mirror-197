InVEST: Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs
================================================================

About  InVEST
=============

InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is a family
of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and
practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in
nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to
quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify
the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with
alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.

InVEST is licensed under a permissive, modified BSD license.
