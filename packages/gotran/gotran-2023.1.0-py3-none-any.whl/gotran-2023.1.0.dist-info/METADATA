# Gotran - General ODE TRAnslator

Gotran:

- provides a Python interface to declare arbitrary ODEs.

- provides an interface for generating CUDA/C/C++/OpenCL/Julia/Python/Matlab code for a number of functions including the right hand side and symbolic generation of a Jacobian.

- is intentionally lightweight, and could be interfaced by other
  Python libraries needing functionalities to abstract a general
  ODE.

- depends on NumPy, and on SymPy. See further instructions in
  INSTALL

- can load models from external ODE description files such as CellML

## Install

You can install gotran through pip

```
python -m pip install gotran
```

or if you want to work with the latest version you can install the developement version by either cloning the repository and run

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/gotran.git
```
