ORGANiSATION OF THE PROGRAM
---------------------------
The SATLAS program consists of several subfolders and .py files. In the different folders, the files are:
    MODELS:
        basemodel.py        --  Implements the BaseModel class used throughout SATLAS
        hfsmodel.py         --  Implements the HFSModel class used for laser spectroscopy
        linkedmodel.py      --  Implements the LinkedModel class, used to fit different datasets at the same time
        models.py           --  Implements the general MiscModel for user-defined functions and PolynomialModel for polynomial fits
        summodel.py         --  Implements the SumModel, used to fit several models on the same data at the same time
        transformmodel.py   --  Implements the TransformHFSModel, which uses a transformation function on both in- and output
    STATS
        EMCEE
            External library written by Dan Foreman-Mackey, copied here for compatibility purposes
        fitting.py          --  gathers all the chisquare and likelihood code
    STYLES
        Collection of cosmetical changes that can be applied to MatPlotLib
    TQDM
        Package written by several authors (see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm), copied here for compatibility purposes.
    UTILITIES
        plotting.py      --     Collection of visualisation routines
        utilities.py     --     Collection of miscellaneous functions used in other scripts
    loglikelihood.py     --     Collection of functions used to calcualte and define log-likelihood calculations
    profiles.py          --     Implementation of different lineshapes used in HFSModel
    version.py           --     Describes the current version of SATLAS

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
If the required packages are already installed, installation is done by copying the entire satlas folder somewhere the Python can access it. Preferentially, the Anaconda Python distribution is used to install NumPy, SciPy and h5py, after which satlas is installed via the command "pip install satlas", which should always be up to date.
