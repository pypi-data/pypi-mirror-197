class BankAccountNumber:
    """
    The Bank Account Number library provides keywords to generate NL specific
    bank account numbers that are 9 digits long and comply with the Elf Proef.
    
    Before the introduction of IBAN most of the Dutch bank account numbers adhered 
    to a mod 11 check, called the Elf proef. This check ensured that simple 
    mistakes  while inputting a bank account number were prevented.
    
    With the introduction of IBAN the mod 11 check became obsolete, as it has 
    its own mod 97 check. The keywords in this library can generate the old style
    account number, or include it in the IBAN format. 
    
    This library depends on the work done by Thomas Gunther <tom@toms-cafe.de>
    that is able to create the IBAN check digit from it's components: Country
    Code, Bank Code and Account Number. This completes the IBAN format:
    
    [Country Code] [Check Digit] [Bank Code] [Account Number]

        This keyword is able to generate one or more Elf Proef compliant account

        the SEPA and IBAN standards. It also aids with those systems who may
        still have this check in place for the IBAN account number part.
        
        The keyword can be called without any arguments when only a single account
        is needed. When multiple account numbers are required the `total` argument
        allows to specify the number of accounts that need to be returned. In
