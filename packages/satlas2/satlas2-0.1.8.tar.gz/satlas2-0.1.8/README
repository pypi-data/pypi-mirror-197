## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

---------------------------
If the required packages are already installed, installation is done by copying the entire satlas2 folder somewhere the Python can access it. Preferentially, the Anaconda Python distribution is used to install NumPy, SciPy and h5py, after which satlas is installed via the command "pip install satlas2", which should always be up to date.
