*Bruteforce (a.k.a. exhaustive search) Plugin for [Omnisolver](https://github.com/euro-hpc-pl/omnisolver)*


## Installation 

Currently, the `omnisolver-bruteforce` package requires working CUDA installation.

To install the plugin first set the `CUDAHOME` environmental library to your CUDA instalaltion location, e.g.:

```shell
# Rmember, your actual location  may vary!
export CUDAHOME=/usr/local/cuda
```

and then run:

```shell
pip install omnisolver-bruteforce
```

> **Warning**
> If you don't set the `CUDAHOME` directory, an attempt will be made to deduce it based on the location of your `nvcc` compiler.
> However, this process might not work in all the cases and should not be relied on.

## Command line usage
