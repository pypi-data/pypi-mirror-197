        # Introduction
        Colors enrich our world and affect our emotions. For artists, they display objects and convey feelings by varied colors in photos, images and drawings. For scientist, they present data by distinguishable colors in figures and graphics. However, the majority of color softwares and websites put restrictions on users, which include the inability to export color palettes into individual files, not providing invocation interfaces, requiring registrations, regional limitations and (or) collecting users' personal information.
        
        If you are running into these issues, Rickrack is the perfect solution for you!
        
        Rickrack is a free and user-friendly color editor. It is designed to generate a set of harmonious colors from the color wheel or other places. You can share these colors with your friends, or apply them into your creative works. You can store the color sets and color boards in the software, and access them whenever you need. What's more, you can export them into individual files, back them up, share them with others or import them in to other softwares such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Krita, Pencil 2D and Clip Studio Paint. Rickrack, written in PySide2, operates effectively on Windows, Linux and other mainstream operating systems.
        
        Rickrack consists of two parts: the Rickrack software and the Rickrack module; the Rickrack software is designed for producing and organizing harmonious colors, and the Rickrack module is utilized for obtaining colors from the software in real-time, along with the plotting of images combined with other modules such as Matplotlib and Turtle.
