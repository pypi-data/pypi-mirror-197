# ALPypeRL

**ALPypeRL** or _AnyLogic Python Pipe for Reinforcement Learning_ is an open source library for connecting **AnyLogic** simulation models with **reinforcement learning** frameworks that are compatible with _OpenAI Gymnasium_ interface (single agent).

![ALPypeRL GIF](resources/images/alpyperl_gif.gif)

With ALPypeRL you will be able to:
* Connect your AnyLogic model to a reinforcement learning framework of your choise (e.g. ray `rllib`).
* Scale your training by launching many AnyLogic models simultaneously (requires an exported model).
* Deploy and evaluate your trained policy.
* Debug your AnyLogic models during training.
* Leverage on the AnyLogic rich visualization while training or evaluating.

There is a more detailed [documentation](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/ALPypeRL/wiki) that includes multiple examples to understand most the basic functionalities.

_NOTE: ALPypeRL has been developed using **ray rllib** as the base RL framework. Ray rllib is an industry leading open source package for Reinforcement Learning. Because of that, ALPypeRL has certain dependencies to it (e.g. trained policy deployment and evaluation)._

## Environments

ALPypeRL inculdes 2 environments that make the connection between AnyLogic and your python scrip possible:
* [ALPypeRLConnector](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/ALPypeRL/wiki/AnyLogicConnector) - The AnyLogic connector ('agent') library to be dropped into your simulation model.
* [alpyperl](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/ALPypeRL/wiki/CartPoleV0) - This environment includes functionalities to _train_ and _evaluate_ RL policies in python. 

## Installation

To install the base **ALPypeRL** library in python, use `pip install alpyperl`.

To use **ALPypeRLConnector** in AnyLogic, you can add the [library](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/ALPypeRL/tree/main/bin) to your _Palette_. That will allow you to drag and drop the connector into your model. _Note that further [instructions](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/ALPypeRL/wiki/AnyLogicConnector) are required to be followed in order for the connector to work_.

## Requirements

The **ALPypeRL** requires you to have the AnyLogic software (or a valid exported model). AnyLogic is a licensed software for building simulations that includes an ample variety of libraries for modelling many industry challenges. At the moment, AnyLogic provides a _free_ license under the name PLE (Personal Learning Edition). There are other options available. For more information, you can visit the [AnyLogic website](https://www.anylogic.com/).

_Note that this is not a package that is currently backed by the AnyLogic support team_.

## API basics

### Training

To be able to train your policy, you must have the following:

* An **AnyLogic model** that requires decisions to be taken as the simulation runs. Using the [CartPole-v0](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/alpyperl/wiki) example, a decision must be taken on the direction of the force to be applied so the pole can be kept straight for as long as possible. For that, the AnyLogic model will be making requests to the **ALPypeRLConnector** and consuming the returned/suggested action.

![ALPypeRL Connector](resources/images/alpyperl_train_api.png)

* A **python script** that contains the RL framework. Here is where the policy is going to be trained. For that, you will need to create your _custom environment_ taking into consideration what your AnyLogic model expects to return and receive. By default, you must define the _action_ and _observation_ spaces. Please visit the [CartPole-v0](https://github.com/MarcEscandell/alpyperl/wiki) example for a more detailed explanation.

```python
from alpyperl.examples.cartpole_v0 import CartPoleEnv
from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig

# Initialise policy configuration (e.g. PPOConfig), rollouts and environment
policy = (
    PPOConfig()
    .rollouts(
        num_rollout_workers=2,
        num_envs_per_worker=2,
    )
    .environment(
        CartPoleEnv,    # Or call `create_custom_env(action_space, observation_space)`
        env_config={
            'run_exported_model': True,
            'exported_model_loc': './resources/exported_models/cartpole_v0',
            'show_terminals': False,
            'verbose': False
        }
    )
    .build()
)

# Create training loop
for _ in range(10):
    result = policy.train()

# Save policy at known location
checkpoint_dir = policy.save("./resources/trained_policies/cartpole_v0")
print(f"Checkpoint saved in directory '{checkpoint_dir}'")

# Close all enviornments (otherwise AnyLogic model will be hanging)
policy.stop()
```

### Evaluation

The evaluation of your _trained policy_ is made simple in **alpyperl**. See the example:

```python
from alpyperl.serve.rllib import launch_policy_server
from alpyperl.examples.cartpole_v0 import CartPoleEnv
from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig


launch_policy_server(
    policy_config=PPOConfig(),
    env=CartPoleEnv,
    trained_policy_loc='./resources/trained_policies/cartpole_v0/checkpoint_000010',
    port=3000
)
```

Once the server is on, you can run your AnyLogic model and test your trained policy. You are expected to select mode _EVALUATE_ and specify the server _url_.

## Bugs and/or development roadmap

At the moment, ALPypeRL is at its earliest stage. You can join the [alpyperl project](https://github.com/users/MarcEscandell/projects/1) and raise bugs, feature requests or submit code enhancements via pull request.
