  Useful to convert a model's `trainable_parameters` (list of tf.Variables) into
  a single vector (more convenient for Lanczos tridiagonalization).

  Args:
    tensor_list: List of tensorflow tensors to convert to a single vector.

  Returns:
    A vector obtained by concatenation and reshaping of the original tensors.
      The shape of the vector will be [w_dim, 1] where w_dim is the total number
      of scalars in the list of tensors.

  Convert a (vertical) vector into a list of tensors, following the shapes of

  ```

  reshaped_weights = vector_to_tensor_list(
    weights_as_vector, structure=model_weights)

  Args:
    vector: A tensor of shape [w_dim, 1], where w_dim is the total number
      of scalars in `structure`.
    structure: List of tensors defining the shapes of the tensors in the
      returned list. The actual values of the tensors in `structure` don't
      matter.

  Returns:
    A list of tensors of the same shape as the tensors in `structure`

  Raises:

      number of scalars in `structure`.
