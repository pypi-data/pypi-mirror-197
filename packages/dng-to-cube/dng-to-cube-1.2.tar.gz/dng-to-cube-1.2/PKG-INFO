DNG to Cube Converter
This is a Python package that provides a command-line interface for converting DNG files to cube files. The package uses the rawpy and numpy libraries to read and manipulate the image data.

Installation
To install the package, use pip:



pip install dng-to-cube
Usage
To convert a DNG file to a cube file, use the dng-to-cube command:


dng-to-cube (input.dng output.cube)


By default, the package generates a 33x33x33 LUT cube file. You can customize the size of the cube using the --size option:


dng-to-cube (input.dng output.cube --size 17)

This generates a 17x17x17 LUT cube file.
