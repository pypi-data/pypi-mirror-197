The concept is to have a personal toolbar that contains all the handy functions that support efficient python software engineering workflows, connectivity to cloud, navigating file systems, parsing date/time formats and pushing notifications to different platforms.

🚩 v0.4.0 is now available with the feature to calculate the stock exposure through your ETFs and stock portfolio

## Features (Usage/Examples)

### Investments (Stock/ETF exposure calculator)
*Available for use from v0.1.0*

#### Limitations (in-scope features)
- This only works on ETFs or Stocks (Individual shares) based portfolio
- Will ignore any other investment holdings that you pass
- It takes in input in form of a JSON structure:
    ```bash
    [
        {
            "isin": "US30303M1027",
            "investment":  185.22,
            "category": "stock" # Optional field
        },
        {
            "isin": "IE00BQQP9H09",
            "investment":  298.22,
            "category": "ETF" # Optional field
        }
    ]
    
    ```
    where `isin` uniquely idenfies a holding, can get it from **Yahoo Finance**/**Trading 212** (personal choice)
- Returns the output in a JSON format 

```python
>>> from whykay.investments.stocks_analyzer import calculate_exposure

>>> data = [
                {

                    "investment":  185.22
                },
                {
                    "isin": "IE00BQQP9H09",
                    "investment":  298.22
                }
            ]
>>> calculate_exposure(
        holdings = data, display = True
