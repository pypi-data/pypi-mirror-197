        **quickGPT** is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python library that
        provides a simplified interface for working with the new API interface
        of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. With quickGPT, you can easily generate natural
        language responses to prompts and questions using state-of-the-art
        language models trained by OpenAI.
        
        For the record, this README.md was (mostly) generated with ChatGPT.
        That’s why it’s a little braggy.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install **quickGPT** using pip:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install quickGPT
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use quickGPT, you’ll need an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain
        from the OpenAI website. Once you have your API key, you can create a
        quickGPT object and start generating responses:
        
        ::
        
           from chattylib import ChattyLib
           from chattylib.thread.messagetypes import *
        
           if __name__ == "__main__":
               chat = ChattyLib()
        
               thread = chat.new_thread()
        
               thread.feed(
                   System("The world is your oyster.")
               )
        
               while True:
                   response = thread.run()
                   print("Bot: %s" % response.message)
        
                   prompt = input("You: ")
        
                   thread.feed(
                       Assistant(response.message),
                       User(prompt)
                   )
        
        Try out ``catbot.py`` in the examples folder for an interactive fuzzface
        experience.
