Developer Documentation
========================

My personal docs for things to do for this project

.. contents::
    :depth: 3

Packaging
-----------

PyPI
^^^^^

Install the required packages for building the wheels.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge hatch twine



Sphinx
------

The following commands were used to create the docs

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-copybutton
    pip install sphinx-reload
    sphinx-quickstart docs

The above commands were installed using ``conda``, but the ``requirements.txt`` is populated using ``pip`` like entries in parallel. This is to install only sphinx packages in the build pipeline for the docs.

Build the docs using

.. code-block:: bash

    # Traditional
    cd docs
    make html

.. code-block:: bash

    # Live reload
    sphinx-reload docs
