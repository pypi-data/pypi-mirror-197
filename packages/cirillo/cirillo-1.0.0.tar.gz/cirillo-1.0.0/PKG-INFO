# Cirillo

Cirillo is a simple command-line application that helps you stay focused and productive by using
the Pomodoro technique. With cirillo, you can easily set work and break times, and the application
will notify you when it's time to take a break.

## Installation

You can install the application by cloning the repository and running the following
commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install cirillo
```

## Usage

To use Cirillo, open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
cirillo
```

This will start the Pomodoro timer with default settings of 25 minutes of work time and 5 minutes of
break time. If you want to set custom times, you can use the --work and --rest options, like this:

```bash
cirillo --work 30 --rest 10
```

This will set the work time to 30 minutes and the break time to 10 minutes.

You can also enable desktop notifications by using the --notify option:

```bash
cirillo --notify
```

This will enable desktop notifications for the Pomodoro timer. Note that this option is only
available on Mac and Linux systems that support notifications.

Once you start the timer, Cirillo will display a progress bar in the terminal, and notify you when
it's time to take a break. When the break is over, Cirillo will automatically start another work
session.
