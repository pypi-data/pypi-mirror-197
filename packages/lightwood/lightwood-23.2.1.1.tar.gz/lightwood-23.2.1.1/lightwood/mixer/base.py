class BaseMixer:
    """
    Base class for all mixers.

    Mixers are the backbone of all Lightwood machine learning models. They intake encoded feature representations for every column, and are tasked with learning to fulfill the predictive requirements stated in a problem definition.
    
    There are two important methods for any mixer to work:
        1. `fit()` contains all logic to train the mixer with the training data that has been encoded by all the (already trained) Lightwood encoders for any given task.
        2. `__call__()` is executed to generate predictions once the mixer has been trained using `fit()`. 
    
    An additional `partial_fit()` method is used to update any mixer that has already been trained.

    Class Attributes:
    - stable: If set to `True`, this mixer should always work. Any mixer with `stable=False` can be expected to fail under some circumstances.
    - fit_data_len: Length of the training data.
    - supports_proba: For classification tasks, whether the mixer supports yielding per-class scores rather than only returning the predicted label.
