# HiPSCat

**Hierarchical Progressive Survey Catalog**

A HiPSCat catalog is a partitioning of objects on a sphere. Its purpose is for 
storing data from large astronomy surveys, but could probably be used for other 
use cases where you have large data with some spherical properties.

## Partitioning Scheme

We use healpix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization 
[[more](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/)]) for the spherical pixelation, and 
adaptively size the partitions based on the number of objects.

In areas of the sky with more objects, we use smaller pixels, so that all the 
resulting pixels should contain similar counts of objects (within an order of 
magnitude).

## File structure

The catalog reader expects to find files according to the following partitioned 
structure:

```
__ /path/to/catalogs/<catalog_name>/
  |__ catalog_info.json
  |__ partition_info.csv
  |__ Norder1/
  |  |__ Npix0/catalog.parquet
  |  |__ Npix1/catalog.parquet
  |__ NorderJ/
     |__ NpixK/catalog.parquet
     |__ NpixM/catalog.parquet
```

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/astronomy-commons/hipscat
$ cd hipscat
$ pip install -e .
```

## Installation (Macs)

Native prebuilt binaries for healpy on Apple Silicon Macs [do not yet exist](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#binary-installation-with-pip-recommended-for-most-other-python-users), 
so it's recommended to install via conda before proceeding to hipscat.
```bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install healpy
$ git clone https://github.com/astronomy-commons/hipscat
$ cd hipscat
$ pip install -e .
``` 

#### Installing dev dependencies

```bash
$ pip install '.[dev]'
```
(Make sure to include the single quotes)
