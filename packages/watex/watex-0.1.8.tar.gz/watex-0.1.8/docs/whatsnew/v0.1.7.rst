v0.1.7 (March 09, 2023)
----------------------------

This is a minor change performed from ``v0.1.6`` and adaptations.  

Adaptations and features 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add new features with strike (:func:`watex.utils.plot_strike`) and confidence plots in the :term:`EDI` data 
  (:func:`watex.utils.plot_confidence_in`). The latter is useful to know the signals to recover and useless
  frequencies for deletion. 

- add confidence interval plot (:func:`watex.utils.plot_confidence_in`). This is useful for data visualization before 
  :term:`tensor`` recovering. It also shows the status of the :term:`EM` data acquired at a specific area and whether 
  data is recoverable or not. If data is unrecoverable, a pure deletion is performed.
