JAXIP - JAX-based Interatomic Potential
=======================================

JAXIP is an optimized Python library that helps in the development of merging machine learning interatomic 
potentials for use in computational physics and chemistry. These potentials are necessary for conducting 
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of complex materials at the atomic level with ab initio accuracy.
