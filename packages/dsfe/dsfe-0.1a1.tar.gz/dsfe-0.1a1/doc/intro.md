# Documentation for the DSFE package

This is a [Jupyter Book prorject](https://jupyterbook.org) containing the documentation for the DSFE package.

The DSFE package is a pip-installable Python package to support data science
teaching.

The documentation is to explain the code in tutorial detail, so the interested student can see how the routines work, and how they would use the same kind of code to do similar things.
