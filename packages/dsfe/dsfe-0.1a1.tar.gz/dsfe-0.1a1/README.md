# Data Science for Everyone

Package to support the DSFE (Data Science For Everyone) textbook.

The most recent version of the textbook at time of writing is the [London
Interdisciplinary School version](https://lisds.github.com/textbook).

The DSFE package contains various routines to ease some of the more complex
calls to various Numpy and Scipy routines.

It is a teaching module as well as a code module.  The idea is to give the
canned routines for common procedures, but treat the canned code as part of
a more advanced tutorial in how the procedures work.
