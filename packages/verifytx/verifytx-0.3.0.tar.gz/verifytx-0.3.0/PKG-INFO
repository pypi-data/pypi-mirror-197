## Introduction
verifytx is a Python library to verify blockchain confirmations and transactions integrated with Excel.
It was born from a lack of existing libraries to verify on-chain transactions automatically and blazingly fast.
All kudos to the openpyxl team and library to read/write natively from Python the Office Open XML format.

## Security
By default verifytx does not guard against quadratic blowup or billion laughs xml attacks. To guard against these install defusedxml.
