    """
    Oligarchy is a form of government in which a small group of people hold power and make decisions on behalf of the society. Here are some key features of oligarchy:

    Concentration of power: Power is concentrated in the hands of a small group of people, such as a ruling elite, aristocracy, or wealthy individuals.
    Limited political participation: The general population has limited or no political participation, and decisions are made by the ruling elite.
    Hierarchical structure: There is often a hierarchical structure in place, with the ruling elite at the top and the rest of the society at lower levels.
    Lack of accountability: The ruling elite are not accountable to the general population, and there are often limited mechanisms in place to hold them accountable.
    Privilege: The ruling elite often enjoy privileges and advantages that are not available to the general population.
