Alpha-AutoML
===========

Alpha-AutoML is an AutoML system that automatically searches for models and derives end-to-end pipelines that read, 
pre-process the data, and train the model. Alpha-AutoML leverages recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and is 
able to adapt to different application domains and problems through incremental learning.

Alpha-AutoML provides data scientists and data engineers the flexibility to address complex problems by leveraging the 
Python ecosystem, including open-source libraries and tools, support for collaboration, and infrastructure that enables 
transparency and reproducibility. 

This repository is part of New York University's implementation of the 
[Data Driven Discovery project (D3M)](https://datadrivendiscovery.org/).
