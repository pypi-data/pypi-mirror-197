# Tasmota Application Development Server

This tool aims to simplify Tasmota Berry script development by doing two things:

* Starts a web app that automatically zips your project(s), and serves it as a `.tapp` file.
* Opens a tunnel to the web app, letting you deploy your Tasmota Application to any device with an internet connection.
