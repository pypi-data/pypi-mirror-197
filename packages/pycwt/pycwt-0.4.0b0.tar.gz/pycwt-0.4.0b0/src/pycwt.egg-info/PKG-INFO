PyCWT
=====

A Python module for continuous wavelet spectral analysis. It includes a
collection of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via FFT
algorithm. In addition, the module also includes cross-wavelet transforms,
wavelet coherence tests and sample scripts.

Please read the documentation `here <http://pycwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__\.

This module requires ``NumPy``, ``SciPy``, ``tqdm``. In addition, you will 
also need ``matplotlib`` to run the examples.

The sample scripts (``sample.py``, ``sample_xwt.py``) illustrate the use of
the wavelet and inverse wavelet transforms, cross-wavelet transform and
wavelet transform coherence. Results are plotted in figures similar to the
sample images.


Disclaimer
----------

This module is based on routines provided by C. Torrence and G. P. Compo
available at http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/, on routines
provided by A. Grinsted, J. Moore and S. Jevrejeva available at
http://noc.ac.uk/using-science/crosswavelet-wavelet-coherence, and
on routines provided by A. Brazhe available at
http://cell.biophys.msu.ru/static/swan/.

the license file for further information. This routine is provided as is
without any express or implied warranties whatsoever.


Installation
------------

We recommend using PyPI to install this package.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install pycwt

However, if you want to install directly from GitHub, use:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt


Acknowledgements
