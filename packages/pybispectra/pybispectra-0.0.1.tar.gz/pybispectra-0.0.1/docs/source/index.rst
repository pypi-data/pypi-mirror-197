A Python signal processing package for computing spectral-domain interactions
using bispectra.

This package provides the tools for computing spectral-domain interactions
between signals such as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) based on bispectra, and
phase-phase coupling (PPC). Parallel processing and
`Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ optimisation are implemented to reduce
computation times. Additional tools for plotting results and computing Fourier
coefficients of data are also provided.
