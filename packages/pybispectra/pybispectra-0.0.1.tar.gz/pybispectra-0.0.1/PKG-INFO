A Python signal processing package for computing spectral-domain interactions using bispectra.

This package provides the tools for computing spectral-domain interactions between signals such as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) based on bispectra, and phase-phase coupling (PPC). Parallel processing and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) optimisation are implemented to reduce computation times. Additional tools for plotting results and computing Fourier coefficients of data are also provided.

## Installation & Requirements:
Install the package into the desired environment using pip `pip install pybispectra`<br/>
[See here for the list of requirements](requirements.txt).

## Use:
To get started with the toolbox, check out the [documentation] and [examples](https://github.com/braindatalab/pybispectra/tree/main/examples).
