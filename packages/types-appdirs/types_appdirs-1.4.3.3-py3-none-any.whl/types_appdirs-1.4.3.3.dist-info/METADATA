## Typing stubs for appdirs

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `appdirs` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`appdirs`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/appdirs. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `843b49e96a14c8b2eaadbb49ea6ef0d5119c0144`.
