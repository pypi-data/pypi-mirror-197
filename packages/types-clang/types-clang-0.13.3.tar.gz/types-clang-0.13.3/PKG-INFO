Type Information for Clang Python Bindings
==========================================

Have you used the `Clang Python Bindings <https://pypi.org/project/clang/>`_, but wanted type hints in your IDE?
Have you ever wanted to use `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_ tools on a project that uses Clang but gotten errors due to
lack of type annotations?
This package is a `PEP 561 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561>`_ stub package which provides type information for
Clang.

In other words, transform your IDE from:

to:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgockel/types-clang/trunk/doc/after.png

To utilize this, add it globally with::

    pip3 install types-clang

Or add ``types-clang`` to ``dev-requirements.txt`` or ``pyproject.toml`` or whatever you use for dependency management.

Versioning
==========

.. note::
    This project is still ``0.x``, so add a ``0.`` in front of the descriptions here.
    In other words, for ``clang`` ``12.0.1``, use ``types-clang`` ``0.12.2``.

The published ``types-clang`` packages correspond with the type information of the ``{major}.{minor}`` of the ``clang``
package.
The patch version of ``types-clang`` does not correspond with any patch version of ``clang``, as they use semantic
versioning correctly and will not add functionality in a patch release.
So, if you install ``clang==13.0.1``, then ``types-clang>=13.0, <13.1`` will have the appropriate stubs.

Best practice is to write the version specification for ``types-clang`` to be the same as the ``clang`` package, but
without the patch.
For `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_::

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    clang = "14.0"

    [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
    types-clang = "14.0"
